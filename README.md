# Predict customer interests in new credit card
In this project, several variables are used to make predictions of whether the existing customers of a bank would be interested in having the new credit card. The analysis and prediction can help the stakeholder (the bank) to target potential customers and understand the deterministic factors of individual customers.\
\
The analysis has been performed in [analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/fiofiofiona/Credit-card-customer-prediction/blob/main/analysis.ipynb) along with all results and figures. A presentation that describes the problem statement and analysis details can be found in the [recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1syIe25O87nmIa2PAg7lfj6KiogJ3OEX7/view?usp=sharing) and the [slides](https://github.com/fiofiofiona/Credit-card-customer-prediction/blob/main/slides.pptx).
